# Tutorial 1 - Baseline

This folder contains the materials for the baseline tutorial, where you'll learn how to take an existing XML file ([baseline_combined.xml](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion/blob/main/examples/Tutorial_1/baseline_combined.xml)) and run it with the [latest EpiFusion executable jar file](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion/releases).

Then you'll use the R package [EpiFusionUtilities](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusionUtilities) to parse and plot the results.
