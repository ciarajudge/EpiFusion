# Examples
In this folder you'll find everything you need for the three tutorials on the wiki.

* [Tutorial 1 - Running an Existing XML ](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion/wiki/Baseline-Tutorial) will guide you through the process of running the EpiFusion program with an existing EpiFusion XML parameter file (provided for you). We then go through how to use the [EpiFusionUtilities R package](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusionUtilities) to parse through the results, and plot them.
* [Tutorial 2 - Setting up an XML with more advanced priors ](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion/wiki/Advanced-Simulated-Tutorial) will show you how to take a tree and case incidence data, and create an EpiFusion XML parameter file from 'scratch' (we'll fill out a template). We'll also go through how to set out a slightly more complex parameterisation, where the data has a step-change in sampling rate.
* [Tutorial 3 - Running EpiFusion on Real Data ](https://github.com/ciarajudge/EpiFusion/wiki/Real-Data-Tutorial): lays out the code for using EpiFusion to model Rt of Ebola Virus in Sierra Leone, as shown in our latest preprint.
