# EpiFusion
This is EpiFusion, a program for jointly inferring epidemic trajectories using phylogenetic and case incidence data via particle filtering. This repository contains the model source code, and other useful examples and templates.


## Getting Started

To get started with EpiFusion you can get started by downloading this executable jar file. To run the program, simply ensure that you have Java 8 installed, and run the following command: 

  ```sh
  java -jar EpiFusion parameterfile.xml
  ```

We recommend using a parameter file from the examples folder for your first attempt at running EpiFusion. These examples should take about 30 minutes to run, and their outputs will be found in your working directory. The output can be plotted and interpreted using the markdown script plot_epifusion_outputs.Rmd in the examples folder. For information on creating your own parameter XML files for EpiFusion, see the 'Parameter XML' section of the wiki.

## Contributing, Collaborating and Feedback
